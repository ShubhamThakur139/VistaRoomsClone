# VistaRoomsClone

A Request: If you want to run our website, first you have to come in roomsapi folder , then run this command `npm run json:server`, after this you can run the index file. (This is mandatory to get the details from api. Otherwise the website will not load the details.)

Shortly, we will put this on netlify, and the respective link.
